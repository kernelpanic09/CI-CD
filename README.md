## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying the application to a staging environment. This ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube)

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**: Compiles the application code and creates a Docker image.
2. **Test**: Runs automated tests to ensure code quality.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-cicd-pipeline.git
    cd example-cicd-pipeline
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    - Ensure you have Docker and Minikube installed.
    - Start Minikube:
      ```bash
      minikube start
      ```

3. **Run the pipeline**:
    - Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline.
