# Example CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying a simple Flask application to a Kubernetes cluster. It is designed to ensure that every change to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed, making the software development process more efficient and reliable.

## Overview

This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using GitHub Actions. The primary objectives of this pipeline are to:
- **Automate Builds**: Each code change triggers a build process, ensuring that the latest code is always compiled and packaged.
- **Run Tests Automatically**: All unit tests are executed with every code change, helping to catch bugs and regressions early.
- **Perform Code Linting**: Code style and quality checks are performed to maintain a clean and readable codebase.
- **Deploy Continuously**: Successful builds are automatically deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the latest version of the application is always available in the staging environment.

This CI/CD pipeline serves as an example for developers looking to implement a robust and scalable DevOps workflow. It covers essential DevOps practices, including continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated testing, and security scanning.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Minikube)
- **Linting**: Flake8
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

### Build Stage

In the build stage, the application code is compiled, and a Docker image is created. This stage ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the application can be containerized.

### Test Stage

The test stage runs automated tests to ensure the application code is functioning as expected. This stage includes unit tests and integration tests to validate different parts of the application.

### Lint Stage

The lint stage checks the code for stylistic errors and potential bugs using Flake8. This stage ensures that the code adheres to the defined coding standards and best practices.

### Deploy Stage

The deploy stage deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. This stage ensures that the application is running in a controlled and replicable environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker
- You have installed Minikube
- You have installed kubectl
- You have a GitHub account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-cicd-pipeline.git
    cd example-cicd-pipeline
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    - Start Minikube:
      ```bash
      minikube start
      ```

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t example-cicd-pipeline .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 example-cicd-pipeline
    ```

3. **Access the application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`

### Running the Pipeline

To trigger the CI/CD pipeline, push changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request targeting the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run the pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Build Fails**:
    - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
    - Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or missing dependencies.

2. **Minikube Start Fails**:
    - Ensure Minikube is installed and correctly configured.
    - Check the Minikube logs for more details.

3. **Pipeline Fails**:
    - Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages.
    - Ensure all required files are committed and pushed to the repository.
