## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying the application to a staging environment. This ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Minikube)
- **Linting**: Flake8

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

### Build Stage

In the build stage, the application code is compiled, and a Docker image is created. This stage ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the application can be containerized.

### Test Stage

The test stage runs automated tests to ensure the application code is functioning as expected. This stage includes unit tests and integration tests to validate different parts of the application.

### Lint Stage

The lint stage checks the code for stylistic errors and potential bugs using Flake8. This stage ensures that the code adheres to the defined coding standards and best practices.

### Deploy Stage

The deploy stage deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. This stage ensures that the application is running in a controlled and replicable environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker
- You have installed Minikube
- You have installed kubectl
- You have a GitHub account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-cicd-pipeline.git
    cd example-cicd-pipeline
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    - Start Minikube:
      ```bash
      minikube start
      ```

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t example-cicd-pipeline .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 example-cicd-pipeline
    ```

3. **Access the application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`
